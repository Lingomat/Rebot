americans#americans are the decendants of the trash europe sent away hundreds of years ago, clearly they managed to breed despite an average iq of 74
AOL#AOL is an ISP used by people who can just about muster the technological proficiency to turn on their computer. They signed up because a CD came with it, or fell out of their 'What Computer' magazine. It's Universally accepted that AOL users are the lowest form of netizen there is.
Buffy#Buffy is quite simply gagging for it and can grab me by my shaft at any time
cs#Short for Counter-Strike, this Half-Life mod is a more realistic sneak-based FPS where you get one life and had better make it count. The weapons in it are absolutely superb, just remember that EED 0wns CS and you'll get along fine.
ctf#A game that's got flags in it and occasionally a grapple hook. You're supposed to do stuff with them but we're yet to quite work out what.

Germans#Ruthlessly efficient cyber-Europe0nz
humor#If I'm being asked to explain humor to you, it's generally because you didn't get that something was a joke. EED make jokes. Quite a lot of them in fact. Occasionally they're even funny.

netscape#Browser for pe0ns that don't know how to, like, run the smaller, faster, more stable browser THAT COMES WITH THEIR FUCKING OS!
ntl#For some reason NTL's peering into the network that WON UK uses, is very nasty indeed. The fault lies with NTL and the problem was reported weeks ago. We can only hope they fix it. Interestingly it does not affect NTL business traffiic going through the same router!
Oiks#The generic term for those gamers 16 and under. Impossibly to tell visually as in real life but the lack of a sense of a mature sense of humor and their willingness to get in pissing contests with people they can't possibly win against, gives them away. Unfortunately sometimes they also have Mad Skillz too dammit.

UnrealTournament#A pointless game of spamming and unskilled scriptor hacking
utweenies#UT weenies are the group of EED that play Unreal Tournament. One or two are actually pretty good at it. The rest of them would be lucky to hit a barn door with a 6-load of rocket spam. However they're still got at UT given that everyone else is even worse at UT.
